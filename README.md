## 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

### 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts **house prices** using the **Linear Regression algorithm** based on features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, and other property attributes.  
The model helps understand how different factors influence housing prices and supports data-driven real estate decisions.
